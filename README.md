# About me
My name is **Anastasiia Munteanu**. I am a student at *KPI University*. This is a demo project from *Dev School* that helps to learn GitHub. It includes 3 folders:
- dev-school-hw2
- dev-school-hw4
- src

  `Src` folder actually contains code from homework 1. The other two folders are self-explanatory: one contains code & screenshots from homework 2, the other - from homework 4.
