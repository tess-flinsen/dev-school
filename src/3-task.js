/*Your task is to construct a building which will be a pile of n cubes.
The cube at the bottom will have a volume of n^3, the cube above will
have volume of (nâˆ’1)^3 and so on until the top which will have a volume
of 1^3.

You are given the total volume m of the building. Being given m can you
find the number n of cubes you will have to build?

The parameter of the function findNb will be an integer m 
and you have to return the integer n such as n^3 +
(n-1)^3 + (n-2)^3 + ... + 1^3 = m if such a n exists or -1 if there is
no such n.

Examples:
findNb(1071225) --> 45
findNb(91716553919377) --> -1*/

function findNb(m) {
    let sum = 0;
    let n = 1;

    while (sum < m) {
        sum += n ** 3;
        if (sum === m) return n;
        n++;
    }

    if (sum === m) return n;
    else return -1;
}

let m = 1071225; //pass the total volume of the building here
console.log(findNb(m));
